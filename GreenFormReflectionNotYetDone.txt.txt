The frosh Orientation

At first i though that the frosh orientation will be boring 
discussing nothing but rules,rules and rules. but i was wrong 
i did not know that there will be games as well. but that was not 
the exciting part. the exciting part was meeting the GD1T. my classmates
for the 1st and 2nd term. i was very excited to know who are the "smart",
"happy go lucky" and also the "bullies" although it seemed there were no bullies.
im usually an "anti-social" guy. so i was very shy when we are suppose to introduce ourselves to 
the others. and because of that event. i learned to enjoy the companies of other's.
the Orientators were also very open towards us. and even though
they are the orientators, it feels like as if they we are part of the GD1T family.

NSTP orientation.

The orientation was somewhat boring. but at least i learnes something.
i learned that anyone cannot graduate college without finishing their nstp course
and we were also given a choice what NSTP  course we will choose.
although i already forgot those three are but anyway, that orientation was useful because i know that
someday i will also need to enroll to the NSTP courses.
