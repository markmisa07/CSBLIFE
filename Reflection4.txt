NSTP orientation.
The orientation was somewhat boring. but at least i learnes something.
i learned that anyone cannot graduate college without finishing their nstp course
and we were also given a choice what NSTP  course we will choose.
although i already forgot those three are but anyway, that orientation was useful because i know that
someday i will also need to enroll to the NSTP courses. oh and i also won the 
Starbuck's gift certificate. although it was only worth a hundred. well back to the topic.
the NSTP orientation help my mind to clearly see my college life. 
and my future life because  students thatwas able to finish an NSTP will be
called someday by the governmentif ever there will be a Emergeny in the philippinnes.
